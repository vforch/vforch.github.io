It appears to be pretty difficult to pin down the artificial life community on what it is they are doing - I find Hofstädter's Strange Loop captures the most fundamental ideas permeating this field.

- work in progress -

The first [ALICE](https://aliceworkshop.org/) (/æ'laɪs/) workshop-a mostly European offshoot of the artificial life community-went down in February 2026 in freezing Copenhagen. It included discussion groups, a meditation session, many group projects, art exhibitions, as well as a panel discussion featuring experts in the field of artificial life. When the panel participants were asked what research in this field is about there was noone with a direct answer. Rather, as I understood, the consensus was that once you know what it is you are doing it's not ALIFE anymore. Not being an insider in this community, I was struck by this lack of a common research agenda but at the same time-lacking a clear direction in my own research interests-felt very much at home with these people.

Looking for sources on what ALIFE is about outside the workshop, I found that the field has been in this state of non-convergence since its inception. For the 30th aniversary of the ALIFE journal in 2024, Randall D. Beer described the state of affairs like this: "[In ALIFE] It may be more fun to think of oneself as a “gonzo” scientist exploring the wild frontier, unencumbered by staid disciplinary boundaries, more Burning Man than Royal Society." He also layed out how the field could mature into a coherent research programme concerned with theoretical biology while still keeping its diversity.

After the panel, people coalesced into working groups - many of them led by the senior researchers who participated as panelists. The projects could be roughly divided into method-driven and theory-driven, where the former was about doing cool stuff with spiking neural networks or neural cellular automata. Under theory-driven projects I'd like to include:

- Self-rewriting programming languages led by Susan Stepney
- Symbiogenesis by Stefano Nichele
- Coarse-graining of dynamic systems by Alex Mordvintsev

Susan pitched her idea by discerning three levels of innovation: L0 - modification of exemplars, L1 - self-modifying generator programs and L2 - self-modifying programming languages. Stefanos project was based on work by a little-known Italian-Norwegian scientist who briefly worked with John v. Neumann on the emergence of superstructures and evolutionary dynamics in simple cellular automata 70 years ago. Alex' project ended up being about making complex systems tractable for the human mind by "translating" them into finite state automata.

All of these projects work with ideas of meta-level descriptions and how they emerge from a base-layer. In combination with other ideas I heard floating around, I think that the fundamental interest many people in this field share inevitably end up in questions about entangled hierachies. An entangled hierachy or heterarchy is a system where there is no apparent beginning or end when looking into its information flows across its levels of organization. It means that “higher” descriptions don’t just summarize “lower” mechanisms - they can become part of the machinery that shapes the lower level. A canonical biological example is the relation between DNA and enzymes: DNA helps specify proteins/enzymes, while enzymes are required to read, copy, and maintain DNA—so the information flow wraps across levels and closes back on itself.

To understand Evolution on a high level we don't have to refer to molecular biology, however, if we give any credence to the idea that Evolution is a "thing", we find ourselves in a situation where the molecular machinery that is necessary to run it is subject to modification through this process and will reshape the rules by which it is performed. Further, since there is no one central process of Evolution, the networks implementing this decentralized process are fuzzily reshaping all the time. This means that the heterarchy we find ourselves entangled in is an ever-shifting structure that is unlikely to be pinned down to a static description.

Thus, it's only fitting that ALIFE seems to lack some structure - it is the realization that we are part of an ever-shifting process of tangled information flows.
