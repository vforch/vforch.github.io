Hi, I'm Valentin Forch! I am a PhD student at TU Chemnitz, Germany. I studied psychology and computer science. My current interests fall between compositionality in perception and thought, and using evolutionary algorithms to create ultra-low memory controllers for microrobots. Check out my [blog](/blog/)
